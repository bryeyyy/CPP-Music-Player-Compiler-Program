# Music-Player-Compiler-Application

This is an implementation of a doubly linked list in c++ as a waveform file audio player.

The waveform audio file player can 
access, organize, and play audio files 
specifically waveform audio files. 


The system includes adding, viewing, 
deleting, and playing all the audio files so 
that the user has control on the audio 
files making it user-friendly and easy to 
navigate.
